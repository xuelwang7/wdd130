      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People who like architecture and art will want to see different perspectives of the world and how different buildings are presented. They will also be interested in some of the notes that I describe under each piece. They will also find the design of the website very well matched with the works, and a lot of information is very clear, and they will also feel the effect of high visual aesthetics, which makes them want to visit my website regularly and recommend it to their friends, because it is also a kind of visual cultural communication. Perhaps some people who have seen the work on the website and would like to also own the paper goods can contact me based on the information on the website.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        They are likely to ask questions such as: they want to click on a link to get information, they want to buy a product or service, they are likely to sign up for an event/offer/benefit/service. They may want to share via email or social media.
        My website regularly notifies me of new releases and gives the first subscribers a 40% discount on paper copies before they are released. I also collaborate with other brands to launch photography and merchandise campaigns and invite subscribers to participate.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Because my site has a great aesthetic, the site's page design is presented comfortably and all information is clear at a glance. Users can quickly find the information they need. And they can easily share to the most popular social networking sites nowadays.
